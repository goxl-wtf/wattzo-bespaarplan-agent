# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository with these settings:
   - Repository name: `wattzo-bespaarplan-agent`
   - Description: `AI-powered energy savings plan (Bespaarplan) generator using MCP servers for Dutch homeowners`
   - Public repository
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the provided script
# First edit the script to replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username
nano push-to-github.sh
# Then run it
./push-to-github.sh

# Option 2: Run commands manually
# Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/wattzo-bespaarplan-agent.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

Your repository should now be live at:
`https://github.com/yourusername/wattzo-bespaarplan-agent`
